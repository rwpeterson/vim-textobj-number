INTRODUCTION                                    *textobj-number-introduction*

textobj-number is a Vim plugin to provide text objects for formatted numbers.
This is an improvement over the builtin 'w' text object since it distinguishes
digit grouping and decimal points from puctuation following the number. In
addition, it can even recognize numbers with a space as the thousands
separator (the ISO standard, and common in Europe). It also recognizes
currency symbols/codes before the number, and common size suffixes after.

Requirements:
- textobj-user (vimscript#2100) <https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user>

INTERFACE                                       *textobj-number-interface*

textobj-number selects numbers with a variety of formatting options.

<Plug>(textobj-number-number)
        Selects a number, supporting:
        - Minus sign in front of number (-1)
        - Thousands separator: space, period, comma
        - Decimal point: period, comma
        - E-notation for powers of ten (4.7e-6)
        - Padded zeros and missing zeros (e.g. 000 and .5)
        separator; a period or comma as decimal point; a fractional
        decimal part without separators; and e-notation for powers of ten.

        Bound to 'an' and 'in' by default.

<Plug>(textobj-number-currency)
        Same as above, but also matches:
        - prefixes for common currency symbols, ISO currency codes, and
          variations on $ such as C$ or NZ$
        - suffixes for Â¢ and common order-of-magnitude abbrevations k, M, B,
          and T used with currency

        Bound to 'a$' and 'i$' by default.
